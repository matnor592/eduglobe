# EduGlobe: Earth Science Learning Through Augmented Reality

EduGlobe is a mobile augmented reality (AR) application designed to enhance Earth science education by providing interactive, immersive learning experiences. This project was developed as a final year project and aims to make complex scientific concepts more engaging and accessible, especially for secondary and pre-university students.

---

## 🌍 Overview

EduGlobe leverages AR technology to bring Earth science topics—such as plate tectonics, the structure of the Earth, and natural phenomena—directly into the classroom or home. With EduGlobe, students can visualize and interact with 3D models, animations, and supplementary multimedia to deepen their understanding of key concepts.

## 🎯 Features

- **Interactive AR Models:** Visualize layers of the Earth, tectonic movements, volcanoes, earthquakes, and more in 3D.
- **Educational Modules:** Each module focuses on a specific Earth science topic with guided narration and quizzes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use by students and educators alike.
- **Supplementary Resources:** Includes images, diagrams, and explanatory videos for enhanced learning.
